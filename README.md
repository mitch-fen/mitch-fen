# I am a Master's student at the University of British Columbia in the [Wildlife Coexistence Lab](https://wildlife.forestry.ubc.ca)

I study coexistence between human recreation and wildlife communities using camera traps, and am also working to apply density estimation methods to partially marked mountain goat populations

I am also passionate about implementing automated detection and classification products to improve the processing of camera trap data
